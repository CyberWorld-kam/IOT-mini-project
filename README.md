<h2>Definition </h2>
A vehicle tracking system combines the use of automatic vehicle location in individual vehicles with software that collects these fleet data for a comprehensive picture of vehicle locations.

<h2>Benefits of Tracking system</h2>
<b>Forensics</b>: vehicle tracking systems can provide valuable digital evidence that can be used in forensic investigations.<br/>
<b>Theft Prevention</b>: can deter theft by providing real-time location data. If a vehicle is stolen, the system can alert the owner immediately, helping to facilitate swift recovery. The vehicle can also be localized at any point of time.<br/>
<b>Reduce Downtime</b>: Efficient routes can increase productivity by reducing downtime, ensuring all deliveries are made on time while reducing fuel costs.<br/>
<b>Asset Tracking</b>:
all assets can be easily tracked. If they get lost or stolen, they can be retrieved right away.

<h2>Tools</h2>
Neo m6 GPS Module<br/>
NodeMCU<br/>
Breadbord<br/>
Firebase<br/>
Arduino<br/>
MIT App Inventor<br/>
